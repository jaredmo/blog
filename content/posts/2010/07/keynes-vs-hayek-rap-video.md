I'll be the first to admit, sometimes the content on this site can be a little dry. I came across a video this week I thought might add a little humor. Anyone who takes Econ 101 hears about John Maynard Keynes, Milton Friedman, and F.A. Hayek. Ususally, our introduction to these individuals is in the form of a documentary film of some sort, complete with a British narrator, [Ken Burns Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Burns_Effect) photo zooming, and a long enough run time to complete a short nap. Well, some intrepid individuals came up with a far more interesting way to introduce us to Hayek, Keynes, and the ideas they embody....a rap video. Enjoy.

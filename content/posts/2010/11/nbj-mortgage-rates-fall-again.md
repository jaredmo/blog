Nashville Business Journal had a [story this morning](http://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2010/11/12/mortgage-rates-fall-again.html) about mortgage interest rates continuing to fall. The 15 year fixed average is barely higher than average annual inflation. It's crazy. If you are in the market for a home, now is the time. It doesn't get any better for buyers than this.

> Long-term mortgage rates fell to new lows this week, after the Federal Reserveâ€™s announcement to step back into the Treasuries market. A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.17 percent in the week ending Nov. 11, down from 4.24 percent last week. A 15-year fix averaged 3.57 percent, down from 3.63 percent last week. Both are the lowest rates since Freddie Mac (OTC BB: FMCC) began keeping track.

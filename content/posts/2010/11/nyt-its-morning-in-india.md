I enjoyed [this article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/opinion/31friedman.html). I used to share projects with Deloitte's office in Hyderabad, India. During busy season, I would work on gathering the relevant project components during the day, discuss the requirements on the phone that night, and when I came in the next morning, there in my inbox would sit the completed project. Pretty amazing, really. One gentleman worked over 400 hours during January 2008 to meet my project deadlines. If there was one thing I learned about that culture. they don't raise slouches.

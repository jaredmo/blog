Harvard Business Review had a good blog post this morning called [On Creative Accounting: Two Creativity Myths](http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2010/11/on-creative-accounting-two-cre.html). The term "creative accounting" conjures up images of Enron, and other massive financial reporting frauds. However, the author points out that creativity, itself, is morally neutral, and because creativity in accounting _can_ be bad, that doesn't mean that it _must_ be bad. Also, I liked the [cartoon](http://www.cartoonbank.com/1991/its-up-to-you-now-miller-the-only-thing-that-can-save-us-is-an-accounting-breakthrough/invt/106254/).

This snippet is from the New York Times this morning. [The article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/business/26view.html?_r=1&hp) is about the current debate to extend the Bush tax cuts or let them expire. This quote made me laugh.

> There is another possible argument for including the rich in these tax cuts, one based on “fairness.” By this reasoning, the wealthy are entitled to low tax rates because they have temporarily had them, and it would now be unfair to take them back. But by that same argument, unemployment insurance should never expire, and every day should be your birthday. “Temporary” has no meaning if it bestows a permanent right.

In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not a member of either political party and have voted for both Democrats and Republicans depending on the issues. With this one, I'm in [Buffet's camp](http://www.cnbc.com//id/39321868). Let the tax cuts expire.

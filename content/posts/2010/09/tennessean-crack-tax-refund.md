Today's Tennessean had an [eye catching headline](http://www.tennessean.com/article/20100928/NEWS03/9280351/-1/RSS05): "2,772 people could be eligible for 'crack tax' refunds in TN". 

You read that correctly, a 'crack tax' refund. From reading the article, it seems our Department of Revenue had been assessing a property tax on crack cocaine dealers. They even "chased people down at the courthouse to get gold chains" to collect it. I knew tax revenues were down, but...seriously? Well, it turns out state law doesn't view crack dealers as "merchants" or "peddlers", and now they all get refunds. So, if there are any crack dealers reading my blog, consider this your alert. That's my home state, folks.

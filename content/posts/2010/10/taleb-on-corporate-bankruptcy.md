But corporations can go bust as often as they like, thus subsidizing us consumers by transferring their wealth into our pockets - the more bankruptcies, the better it is for us. Government is a more serious business and we need to make sure we do not pay the price for its folly. As individuals we should love free markets because operators in them can be as incompetent as they wish. 

-Nassim Nicholas Taleb, _The Black Swan_

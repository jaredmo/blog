You may have noticed the blog posts have been in short supply since last year. Well, frankly, it's because I've been a lot busier and the nature of my work has changed significantly. Instead of spending hours debugging code and writing the perfect formula in Excel, I'm now delegating responsibilities and managing people. This has been an exciting and different world for me. As far as my plans for this blog, I'm still going to post the odd technical tip as projects come up, but I may shift some focus to current accounting news and people management since that's where I am spending my time these days. (Write about what you know?) Thanks for hanging with me and continuing to visit.

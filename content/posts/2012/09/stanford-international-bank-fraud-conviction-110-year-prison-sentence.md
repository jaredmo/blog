Two years ago, I [wrote a long post](/posts/2010/10/stanford-international-bank-sib-fraud) about the [Stanford International Bank Fraud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_International_Bank). 

I recently thought about the story and realized I never followed up to see what happened. After a quick Google search, I was pleased to see that Allen Stanford was [convicted and sentenced to 110 years in prison](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/business/stanford-sentenced-to-110-years-in-jail-in-fraud-case.html?ref=robertallenstanford&moc.semityn.www). 

The most amazing part is even after his conviction Stanford still claims he wasn't running a Ponzi scheme and the government is responsible for his victims' losses. Incredible.

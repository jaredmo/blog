There is a geometric equation going around the internet that supposedly generates the Batman symbol. Best I can tell, it started at [this site](http://www.hardocp.com/news/2011/07/29/batman_equation/), and blew up from there. A user at Stack Exchange took it upon himself to [test whether it worked](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/54506/is-this-batman-equation-for-real). He mapped out the various functions and looks like it does. Pretty cool.

I am a financial systems leader and Certified Public Accountant in Nashville's healthcare industry. My current role is Head of Financial Business Systems at [Lyra Health](https://www.lyrahealth.com/), a global EAP with operations on six continents. During my time, Lyra has expanded from a US-only business to an international business with a worldwide network of subsidiaries. My team has implemented Coupa, Zuora, Avalara, and numerous NetSuite modules as the business has scaled. We support several layers of multi-currency consolidation in both GAAP and IFRS as well as global tax reporting.

Prior to Lyra, I spent many years with [AMSURG](https://www.amsurg.com) as well as [Deloitte](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en.html). I am an experienced people manager, and enjoy training on the intersection of accounting and technology.
